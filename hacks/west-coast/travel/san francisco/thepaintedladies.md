# UI Hierarchy Lesson: Painted Ladies Theme

## What is UI Hierarchy?
UI hierarchy organizes elements by importance. Think of the Painted Ladies—the central Victorian homes dominate Alamo Square, with their ornate details and skyline backdrop arranged to guide visitors naturally through the iconic scene.

## The 3 Levels of Hierarchy

### Primary (The Victorian Facades)
Most important content—as striking as the colorful Queen Anne mansions.
- Main headlines, key buttons, hero images

### Secondary (Architectural Details)
Supporting information—like the decorative trim, bay windows, and turrets.
- Subheadings, section titles, secondary buttons

### Tertiary (Paint Colors & Accents)
Additional details—individual color schemes, spindles, and decorative flourishes.
- Body text, captions, metadata

## 5 Tools to Create Hierarchy

### 1. Size
Like the grand Victorian homes rising above the park.
- Primary: 32-48px
- Secondary: 24-32px
- Tertiary: 14-16px

### 2. Weight
Bold structural elements vs. delicate gingerbread trim.
- Primary: Bold (700)
- Secondary: Semi-bold (600)
- Tertiary: Regular (400)

### 3. Color
Vibrant pastels against green park and city skyline.
- High contrast for primary
- Medium for secondary
- Low for tertiary

### 4. Spacing
The open park creates perfect viewing distance—use white space the same way.

### 5. Position
Your eyes travel to the row of houses first—center and elevated draw attention.

## Exercise: Painted Ladies Website

**Primary**: "Explore the Painted Ladies" + "Visit Alamo Square" button  
**Secondary**: "San Francisco's Victorian Icons Since the 1890s" + section titles  
**Tertiary**: Architecture history, photography guides, neighborhood info, footer links

## Common Mistakes

1. Making everything important—nothing stands out
2. Too many font sizes—stick to 3-4 maximum
3. Ignoring spacing—use space for impact
4. Inconsistent styling—maintain Victorian elegance like the homes do
5. Poor contrast—you need clarity to showcase colorful details

## Quick Tips

- Limit to 1-2 fonts
- Create dramatic contrast (pastel homes against modern skyline)
- Test by squinting—structure should still be clear
- Use familiar patterns (approach → park → view → details)
