# UI Hierarchy Lesson: Palace of Fine Arts Theme

## What is UI Hierarchy?
UI hierarchy organizes elements by importance. Think of the Palace of Fine Arts—the grand rotunda dominates the landscape, with colonnades and lagoon arranged to guide visitors naturally through the architectural wonder.

## The 3 Levels of Hierarchy

### Primary (The Rotunda)
Most important content—as majestic as the 162-foot central dome.
- Main headlines, key buttons, hero images

### Secondary (The Colonnades)
Supporting information—like the sweeping curved colonnades that frame the space.
- Subheadings, section titles, secondary buttons

### Tertiary (Decorative Details)
Additional details—ornate sculptures, weeping maidens, and reflecting pool.
- Body text, captions, metadata

## 5 Tools to Create Hierarchy

### 1. Size
Like the rotunda rising above the colonnades and lagoon.
- Primary: 32-48px
- Secondary: 24-32px
- Tertiary: 14-16px

### 2. Weight
Massive Roman columns vs. delicate sculptural details.
- Primary: Bold (700)
- Secondary: Semi-bold (600)
- Tertiary: Regular (400)

### 3. Color
Warm terracotta against lush greenery and blue lagoon.
- High contrast for primary
- Medium for secondary
- Low for tertiary

### 4. Spacing
The open lagoon creates breathing room—use white space the same way.

### 5. Position
Your eyes travel to the rotunda first—top and center command attention.

## Exercise: Palace of Fine Arts Website

**Primary**: "Discover the Palace of Fine Arts" + "Plan Your Visit" button  
**Secondary**: "A Beaux-Arts Masterpiece Since 1915" + section titles  
**Tertiary**: Event information, photography tips, parking details, footer links

## Common Mistakes

1. Making everything important—nothing stands out
2. Too many font sizes—stick to 3-4 maximum
3. Ignoring spacing—use space for impact
4. Inconsistent styling—maintain classical elegance like the Palace does
5. Poor contrast—you need clarity to showcase architectural beauty

## Quick Tips

- Limit to 1-2 fonts
- Create dramatic contrast (terracotta columns against sky)
- Test by squinting—structure should still be clear
- Use familiar patterns (entrance → colonnade → rotunda → lagoon)
