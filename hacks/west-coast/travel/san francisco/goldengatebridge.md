# UI Hierarchy Lesson: Golden Gate Bridge Theme

## What is UI Hierarchy?
UI hierarchy organizes elements by importance. Think of the Golden Gate Bridge—the iconic towers dominate the skyline, with suspension cables and roadway arranged to guide visitors naturally across the span.

## The 3 Levels of Hierarchy

### Primary (Main Towers)
Most important content—as commanding as the 746-foot Art Deco towers.
- Main headlines, key buttons, hero images

### Secondary (Suspension Cables)
Supporting information—like the sweeping main cables that connect everything.
- Subheadings, section titles, secondary buttons

### Tertiary (Roadway Details)
Additional details—individual lanes, railings, and rivets.
- Body text, captions, metadata

## 5 Tools to Create Hierarchy

### 1. Size
Like the towers rising above the fog and water.
- Primary: 32-48px
- Secondary: 24-32px
- Tertiary: 14-16px

### 2. Weight
Massive steel cables vs. delicate vertical suspender ropes.
- Primary: Bold (700)
- Secondary: Semi-bold (600)
- Tertiary: Regular (400)

### 3. Color
International Orange against gray fog and blue bay.
- High contrast for primary
- Medium for secondary
- Low for tertiary

### 4. Spacing
The bridge's elegant span uses space to create drama—use white space the same way.

### 5. Position
Your eyes travel to the towers first—top and center command attention.

## Exercise: Golden Gate Bridge Website

**Primary**: "Cross the Golden Gate Bridge" + "Plan Your Visit" button  
**Secondary**: "San Francisco's Iconic Landmark Since 1937" + section titles  
**Tertiary**: Bridge facts, visiting hours, parking info, footer links

## Common Mistakes

1. Making everything important—nothing stands out
2. Too many font sizes—stick to 3-4 maximum
3. Ignoring spacing—use space for impact
4. Inconsistent styling—maintain engineering precision like the bridge does
5. Poor contrast—you need clarity in San Francisco fog

## Quick Tips

- Limit to 1-2 fonts
- Create dramatic contrast (orange tower against gray sky)
- Test by squinting—structure should still be clear
- Use familiar patterns (approach → tower → span → vista)
