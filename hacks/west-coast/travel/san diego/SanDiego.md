# San Diego

# Petco Park Audio Lesson:
## Adding Audio to a Webpage
Learn how to add and control audio using HTML with sounds from the San Diego's Petco Park
### **1. What It Does**  
Use the `<audio>` tag to play clips (music, nature, narration) directly in the browser.
### **2. Prepare Files**  
Save audio files like:  
`/audio/petco-park.mp3`, `/audio/san-diego-zoo.mp3`, `/audio/balboa-park.mp3`, `/audio/la-jolla.mp3`

### **3. Basic Structure**  
Each section should include a heading, a short description, and an audio player.

<section class="bg-gray-100 p-6 rounded-2xl shadow-md max-w-lg mx-auto text-center">
  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Audio you will be working with: Petco Park Atmosphere</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-600 mb-4">
    Listen to authentic game-day sounds from the Padres’ home stadium — cheers, announcers, and that unmistakable Petco Park energy.
