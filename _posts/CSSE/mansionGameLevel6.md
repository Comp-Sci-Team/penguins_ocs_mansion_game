# Level 6 Game Blog

This is the final level of our class game, level 6. 

## Introduction

This level will provide the player with the final ____ that they need to escape the haunted mansion. However, unlike the other levels where there were games or puzzles to be solved, this level offers a twist: A boss fight.

## Rooms

This level has 2 rooms: an intro chamber and the boss room.

### Intro Chamber

This intro chamber is mostly empty, on having torches and chairs in the background. However, it does have a zombie that will speak if "e" is clicked.
