# Level 6 Game Blog

This is the final level of our class game, level 6. 

## Game Overview

#### Introduction

This level will provide the player with the final key that they need to escape the haunted mansion. However, unlike the other levels where there were games or puzzles to be solved, this level offers a twist: A boss fight.

#### Rooms

This level has 2 rooms: an intro chamber and the boss room.

##### Intro Chamber

This intro chamber is mostly empty, on having torches and chairs in the background. However, it does have a zombie that will speak if "e" is clicked.

As you can see in the image, the room is mostly barren, as that is a trend we noticed right before a boss fight. There is also an arrow pointing towards the door in case the player missed that somehow. this room has no fights, as it would be unfair to hurt the player before the big boss fight. 

#### Zombie NPC

In the image, you can see a zombie NPC in the room. This NPC doesn't attack. However, when you go up to him and click "e", he gives dialogues trying to demotivize you.

The zombie has a selection of dialogue to say:

"I heard the boss is waiting for you...",  
"Enter if you dare... he's waiting for you...",  
"I heard the Reaper himself was in there.",  
"The Reaper'll get you good.",  
"You have no chance... his power is unstopable...",  
"No one has survived a battle against the Reaper.",  
"Haha? You want to battle my boss? You'll die within the first minute...",  
"Go ahead. I aint stoppin' you, the Reaper'll finish you clean.",  
"You are a fool to challenge the Reaper.",  
"You will end up like me once you face the Reaper.",  
"Are you the next opponent for my master? That's unfortunate for you.",  
"Why I won't attack you? Well, my master will finish you off soon enough."  

#### Cutscene into boss room

When the player walks up to the door and clicks "e", a prompt show up asking the player if they are sure that they want to go through. If they click "Not ready", the prompt closes. However, if they click "Enter the doors", a small cutscene shows up, in which the words "YOUR FATE HAS BEEN SEALED" get written on the screen and then are deleted.

After the words disappear, you are transported into the second room. This is the boss room.

#### Boss Room

In this room, there is the actual boss fight. This boss fight is designed to be hard to the point that the player takes multiple attempts to beat it. 

#### The Reaper

The boss of this level is the skeleton reaper.

As you can see in the image, the boss is a hooded skeleton with 4 floating arms around him. In the game, he chases you around and if he collides with you, you will die. 

#### Attacks

The boss uses 3 long range weapons in this fight. Arrows, fireballs, and a scythe.

## Our team's challenges

There were a lot of challenges that we faced throughout the creation of this level. One challenge that we faced was the boss creating bugs and issues. We had several issues with the boss fight such as projectiles not appearing, and the boss and player not moving.
